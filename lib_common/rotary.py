rotary.py

Quadrature-transition based KY-040 rotary encoder driver for MicroPython
(Raspberry Pi Pico or any board with machine.Pin IRQ support).

Usage:

    from machine import Pin
    from rotary import Rotary, RotaryEvent
    import utime as time

    dt = Pin(0, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)
    clk = Pin(1, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)
    r = Rotary(dt_pin=dt, clk_pin=clk)

    while True:
        event = r.consume()
        if event == RotaryEvent.CW:
            print("CW")
        elif event == RotaryEvent.CCW:
            print("CCW")
        time.sleep_ms(10)

No switch (SW) handling is included -- this module only reports rotation
direction. No external libraries are used beyond `machine`, so type
enforcement is done manually via isinstance() checks and plain int
constants (MicroPython has no `enum` module in the base build).

Note: dt_pin and clk_pin must already be configured as Pin.IN before
being passed in. This is not checked or enforced -- Rotary just uses
the pins as given.

from machine import Pin


class RotaryEvent:
    """
    Namespace of direction constants returned by Rotary.consume().

    Kept as a separate class (rather than attributes on Rotary) so that
    the return type of Rotary.consume() can be described independently
    of the encoder driver itself.
    """

    NONE = 0  # no event since the last consume()

class Rotary:
    """
    KY-040 rotary encoder reader using a quadrature transition table.

    Only tracks the most recent direction event. Call consume() to fetch
    and clear it. If multiple steps occur between consume() calls, only
    the latest one is kept (no queueing).

    dt_pin and clk_pin must be pre-constructed machine.Pin objects,
    already configured as inputs (Pin.IN) with whatever pull mode you
    want. This keeps pin setup/ownership with the caller rather than
    the Rotary class.

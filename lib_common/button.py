"""Debounced push-button driver with short/long press detection.

This module provides a `Button` class for MicroPython that wraps a
`machine.Pin` configured as a digital input, using an interrupt handler
to detect edges, debounce noisy transitions, and classify presses as
either short or long based on configurable timing thresholds.
